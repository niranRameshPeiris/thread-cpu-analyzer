# ðŸ§µ Thread CPU Usage Analyzer

A web-based tool to analyze Java thread dumps and correlate per-thread CPU usage from system thread usage reports.

Built with Node.js + Express + HTML5, this app helps you:
- Upload a thread usage file and a thread dump file
- Automatically match TID (decimal) with nid (hexadecimal)
- Display CPU usage, thread name, and JVM TID
- Quickly identify the most CPU-intensive threads in a visual table
