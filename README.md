🧵 Thread CPU Usage Analyzer

A web-based tool to analyze Java thread dumps and correlate per-thread CPU usage from system thread usage reports.

Built with Node.js + Express + HTML5, this app helps you:
	•	Upload a thread usage file and a thread dump file
	•	Automatically match TID (decimal) with nid (hexadecimal)
	•	Display CPU usage, thread name, and JVM TID
	•	Quickly identify the most CPU-intensive threads in a visual table

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the Project

git clone https://github.com/your-username/thread-cpu-analyzer.git
cd thread-cpu-analyzer

2. Install Dependencies

npm install

3. Start the Server

npm start

Then open your browser at:

http://localhost:3000

📂 Upload File Format

✅ Thread Usage File (e.g., thread_usage_2025-04-29-22:25:37.txt)

Example format:

 PID     TID %CPU     TIME NLWP  C
  50      53  0.9 00:07:41  529  0

✅ Thread Dump File (e.g., thread_dump_2025-04-29-22:25:37.txt)

Java thread dump with lines like:

"Thread-1" #10 prio=5 tid=0x00007f8d1c015000 nid=0x35 runnable

⸻

🧠 How It Works
	1.	User uploads a usage file and a thread dump.
	2.	The backend parses:
	•	TID and %CPU from the usage file
	•	nid, tid, and thread name from the dump
	3.	TID (decimal) is converted to hex (NID), and matched against the dump.
	4.	Results are sorted by CPU usage and displayed in a table:

CPU Usage | TID | NID | JVM TID | Thread Name
